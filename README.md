- 👋 Hi, I’m @jujuwong21 (Juliette Wong)!
- 🏫 I'm a recent 2021 graduate at Carnegie Mellon University, where I studied Math (Operations Research and Statistics Concentration) with minors in Human-Computer Interaction and Chinese Studies.
- 📊 I am an aspiring data analyst, data scientist, or visualization engineer. I am particularly interested in the intersection between data visualization, ML/statistical models, and design.
- 💞️ In my free time, I enjoy dancing, designing, listening to K-Pop (Super Junior/SuperM/NCT Stan), and watching baseball (Mets and Pirates)!
- 📫 Feel free to reach out to me via email: jnwong@andrew.cmu.edu. You can also visit [my website](https://www.juliettewong.com/)!
